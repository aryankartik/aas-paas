# 🌐 Aas-Paas | Find What’s Around You

We often miss out on what's happening nearby — maybe a college fest, a local event, or even a critical weather alert.  
That’s where **Aas-Paas** comes in.

This is a simple, useful website that shows you what’s going on *around you* — from nearby events and announcements to live weather updates.  
We built this platform as our **major college project**, aiming to solve a real-world problem in a clean and functional way.

## 💡 Why We Built This

The idea came from a common frustration: updates about events were scattered across WhatsApp groups, notice boards, and random posters.

So we thought — **why not make one platform** where users can view everything happening around them, just by selecting a city?

That’s how the concept of **Aas-Paas** was born.
