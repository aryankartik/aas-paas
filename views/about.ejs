      <p><strong>Aas Paas</strong> is your friendly neighborhood platform that keeps you updated with everything happening
        around you — events, announcements, and more. We're here to bridge the information gap and connect communities
        through real-time, relevant local content.</p>
  
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>We aim to empower individuals and communities by providing timely and trusted local information. Whether it's a
        college fest, a blood donation camp, or a government notice — if it's near you, it's on Aas Paas.</p>
  
      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>We’re first-year students from IIT Patna, and Aas-Paas is our capstone project. It started with a simple goal —
        to build something real and useful for local communities. This platform reflects our passion for tech and
        meaningful impact, even in our early journey.</p>
